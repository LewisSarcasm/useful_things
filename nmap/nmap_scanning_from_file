Get ips from file and do full syn port scan:  
cat ips.txt | xargs -i nmap -sS -vv -A -p0- -oA nmap_scan_syn_{} {} 

full udp port scan:
cat ips.txt | xargs -i nmap -sU -vv -A -p0- -oA nmap_scan_udp_{} {} 

This is useful if you have many IPs - nmap doesn't have pause functionality - if your scan breaks halfway through a big scan, this is not good!
