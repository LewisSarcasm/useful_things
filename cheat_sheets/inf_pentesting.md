# INF testing cheat sheet 


## Network services
### SNMP testing
- simple network management protocol 
- SNMP is accessed by proving a valid community string within a UDP datagram to port 161
- two community strings: 
  - one proving read-only access to SNMP Managed Information Base (MIB)
  - one to provide both read and write access
  

- MIB is a heirachy of Object identifier (OID) values 

Obtaining an MIB via SNMP:
- SNMP version 1
- community string: public

```bash
snmpwalk -v 1 -c public 10.10.10.1
```
